	<h1>Meet the college dropout who invented the
		gravitational wave detector
	</h1>

		Nearly 50 years ago, Rainer Weiss dreamed up a way to
		detect <a href="#">gravitational waves</a>—infinitesimal ripples in spacetime
		predicted by Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity. Last
		September, that dream came true as 1000 physicists working with
		the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO),
		two huge detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford,
		Washington, sensed a pulse of waves radiated by two massive
		black holes as they spiraled into each other a billion light-years
		away. The discovery makes Weiss, a physicist at the
		Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, a sure
		bet to win a Nobel Prize, his peers say. Weiss, 83, acknowledges
		the prospect with some apprehension. “It will fuck me up for a
		year,” he predicts as he nimbly steers his silver Volkswagen Beetle
		ragtop through Cambridge traffic. “That’s what it did to John
		Mather.” The line is vintage “Rai,” his friends will tell you: blunt,
		irreverent, funny, and impatient with anything that gets in the way
		of his work.

		Weiss is also known for speaking his mind. “He is absolutely 100%
		committed to honesty both in his physics and in life,” says Peter
		Saulson, a LIGO physicist at Syracuse University in New York, who
		worked with Weiss at MIT in the 1980s. Dirk Muehlner, a retired
		physicist in Alamo, California, and one of Weiss’s early graduate
		students, shares that sentiment. “He’s totally honest. There’s no
		bullshitting for Rai. There’s no performance.”

		As a teenager, Weiss developed two passions: classical music and
		electronics. Snapping up army surplus parts, he repaired radios out
		of his bedroom. He even made a deal with the local toughs: If they
		left him alone as he lugged radios to and from the subway, he’d fix
		theirs for free. “They would steal things and I would have to fix
		them,” he says. “It wasn’t a good deal.”

		Weiss’s sister, playwright Sybille Pearson, confirms that Weiss
		spent as much time as possible out of the unhappy home. But, as
		the only son, he was still something of a prince in his family, she
		says. For example, whenever the family moved to a new
		apartment, Weiss got the biggest bedroom to himself, she recalls.
		In the late 1960s that connection remained tenuous, however.
		Radiation from the big bang should have a “thermal spectrum” with
		a lopsided peak indicating the radiation’s temperature. At long
		wavelengths, several groups had observed a climbing spectrum
		consistent with a temperature of 3°C above absolute zero. But in
		1968, rocket measurements found high amounts of shorter
		wavelength radiation that clashed with a thermal spectrum and
		threatened the big bang hypothesis.

		In the 1970s, Rainer Weiss made his name studying the cosmic microwave background with balloons.

		To probe the matter, Weiss and his graduate student Muehlner built
		a device that would fly on a weather balloon and measure the
		microwave spectrum to shorter wavelengths. In 1973, after three
		flights and a rebuild, they had solid data that fit a thermal spectrum
		and for the first time revealed the telltale peak. “It completely
		destroyed the rocket result,” Burke says. “Among those interested
		in the microwave background, [Weiss] was suddenly one of their
		stars.”

		that the CMB has a thermal spectrum. It also sensed tiny 1-partin-
		100,000 variations in the CMB’s temperature from point to point
		on the sky—traces of infinitesimal quantum fluctuations in the
		newborn universe that are essential to the standard model of
		cosmology. In 2006, Americans John Mather and George Smoot
		shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for, respectively, measuring the
		spectrum and detecting the fluctuations.

		Weiss realized that output could reveal a passing gravitational
		wave, which generally would stretch the arms by different amounts.
		He let the class chew on the idea in homework and wrote a 23-
		page report in the quarterly newsletter of MIT’s Research
		Laboratory of Electronics. LIGO sprouted from that document.

		Weiss insists the concept of an interferometric detector was
		already “floating around.” But others say he was the first to spell
		out that the detector would have to be kilometers long and to
		describe how to deal with the various types of noise—from seismic
		vibrations to the pinging of individual photons on the mirrors—that
		could drown out the elusive waves.
	</p>

		In the meantime, Weiss became a fixture in Building 20, identifiable
		by the corncob pipes he smoked until he suffered a mild heart
		attack in 1995. He would work until 2 a.m., says Nergis Mavalvala,
		a LIGO physicist at MIT who was Weiss’s graduate student from
		1990 to 1997, and would stay even later to help a student. When
		Mavalvala failed her qualifying exams, Weiss had her attend
		“reform school” in his office every Saturday for weeks. “He didn’t
		give a damn about the exams,” Mavalvala says. “But he knew that I
		had to get past them.”

		Weiss earned a reputation for lending nontraditional students a
		helping hand. In 1983, Lyman Page, who had been out of school
		for 5 years and had spent 2 years sailing around the world, walked
		into Weiss’s lab and asked whether he could work for him. “He said
		‘I can’t pay you, but you can work in the lab,’” Page says. “So I
		worked as a carpenter during the day and in the lab at night.”
		Page, now a cosmologist at Princ eton, credits Weiss for giving him
		a chance that others did not.

		to reflect that in the photo of Weiss at the lab bench, he is working
		on equipment for measurements of the cosmic microwave
		background.
